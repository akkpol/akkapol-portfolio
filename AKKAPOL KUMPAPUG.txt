Executive Summary

AI-assisted problem solver with a strong execution background in enterprise systems and internal tools. I focus on using AI to improve the quality of thinking and decision-making, rather than simply accelerating execution. My approach emphasizes asking the right questions, reducing cognitive blind spots, and testing assumptions before action. I work with AI as a research and thinking partner to turn complex or ambiguous situations into clear, practical directions. With hands-on experience in building and operating real systems, I believe long-term value comes from combining modern technology with sound human judgment.
